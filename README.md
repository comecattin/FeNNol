# FeNNol
### Force-field-enhanced Neural Networks optimized library
FeNNol is a library for building, training and running neural network potentials for molecular simulations. It is based on the JAX library and is designed to be fast and flexible.


## Installation
You can start with a fresh environment using conda:
```bash
conda create -n fennol python=3.10 pip
conda activate fennol
```

The first step is to install jax (see details at: https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
For a conda installation with CUDA 11.8, use:
```bash
conda install jaxlib=*=*cuda11* jax=0.4.25 cuda-nvcc=11.8 -c conda-forge -c nvidia
```
and make sure that jax uses the correct version of CUDA/CuDNN/ptxas by correctly setting your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
For example, you can update the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as following so that jax uses the CUDA libraries that you just installed with conda:
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/miniconda3/envs/fennol/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Then, you can clone and install FeNNol using pip:
```bash
git clone ...
cd FeNNol
pip install -e .
```

*Optional dependencies*:
- Some modules require e3nn-jax (https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn-jax) which can be installed with:
```bash
pip install --upgrade e3nn-jax
```
- The provided training script requires pytorch (at least the cpu version) for dataloaders:
```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
- For the Deep-HP interface, cffi, pydlpack and pycuda are required:
```bash
conda install cffi pydlpack pycuda
```
